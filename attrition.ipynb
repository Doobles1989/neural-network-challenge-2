        "YOUR ANSWERS HERE\n",
        "\n",
        "1. No, accuracy may not be the best metric due to potential class imbalance in the dataset. If one class significantly outnumbers another, a model could achieve high accuracy by predominantly predicting the majority class, which would not reflect its true performance. Metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's effectiveness, particularly in identifying the minority class, which is often more critical in applications like attrition prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. I used the softmax activation function for both output layers. Softmax is appropriate for multi-class classification tasks, such as predicting the Department, as it converts the raw output scores into probabilities that sum to one, allowing for easy interpretation of class likelihoods. For the Attrition output, while softmax can be used, a sigmoid activation function is typically preferred for binary classification. However, in this case, softmax was chosen to maintain consistency across both outputs since we are using categorical cross-entropy for loss calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Several strategies could enhance the model's performance:\n",
        "Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different architectures, such as varying the number of layers, units per layer, and learning rates, could lead to better results.\n",
        "Regularization Techniques: Implementing dropout layers or L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting, especially if the model is complex relative to the training data size.\n",
        "Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms) could provide the model with more informative inputs.\n",
        "Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models (e.g., bagging, boosting) can improve overall performance and robustness.\n",
        "Class Weighting: If the classes are imbalanced, applying class weights during training can help the model focus more on the minority class, improving its predictive capability for that group."
